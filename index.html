      <p>Here is a sample of some of the <em>projects</em> I have been working on:</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/1st-webpage-practice">1st-webpage-practice</a></h2>
      <p>As the title implies this was my <span class="highlight">first</span> project. It was one many projects that would teach me how to understand html. There are two html pages: one is mock-up of a website, and the second is a list of some of my favorite things; mostly has photos of friends and family. Also included is a README.md file, a css file with a stylesheet, and an img file.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/CupOfCakes"> CupOfCakes</a></h3>
      <p>This was my <span class="highlight">second</span> project. I worked on this project with Amiya; one of the people in my dev team. I learned a lot from her and this project. I learned more about divs, spans, and classes. The languages used in this project were md, html, and css.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/OLGON92/pet-website-blog">pet-website-blog<a></h4>
      <p>This is a blog about one of my cats. This was more of a side/further exploration project that incorporates most of the things I have been learning in my classes at <span class="highlight">epicodus</span>. It uses the same languages that can be found on my previous projects; and they are: md, html, and css. It is still a work in progress as I continue to play with different styles.</p>
